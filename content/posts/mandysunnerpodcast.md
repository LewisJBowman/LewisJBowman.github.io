Recently, I had the opportunity to be interviewed by the excellent Mandy Sunner (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunnermandy/>) for her new podcast series “The Mandy Sunner Show” (<https://www.youtube.com/@TheMandySunnerShow>).  Mandy and I discuss our personal motivations that drive us to the office each day and what inspires us to do better, and I don’t drone on about tech... too much.

Doing a video podcast is a rare experience for me. I’d like to thank her so much for the opportunity, and encourage you all to take a look at her new series.  I’m certainly going to watch the other episodes!
